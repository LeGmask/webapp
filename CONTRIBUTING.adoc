# Commit messages conventions

This repository follows the https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji[gitmoji] commit standard.
Additonal conventions are added on top of the intent-indicating emoji. Here's how commit titles should be constructed:

```
EMOJI [SCOPE_PREFIX SCOPE: ] IMPERATIVE_SENTENCE
```

With:

EMOJI :: The emoji used. Must follow the gitmoji stanard.
SCOPE_PREFIX :: Indicates if the changes apply to one particular area of the codebase. Must be one of the <<Scope Prefix characters>>
SCOPE :: Indicates the file/topic affected.
IMPERATIVE_SENTENCE :: A sentence at the imperative tense, indicating the change applied to the codebase.


## Scope Prefix characters
The scope prefix indicates what area of the codebase changed.
Less specific than the scope itself, but useful because file names overlaps. (eg. homework is a page & vuex module)

[horizontal]
$ :: Store (vuex)
# :: Components
/ :: Pages
^ :: Plugins
? :: Tests
% :: Layouts
~ :: Middlewares
&nbsp; :: Other (no scope prefix)
