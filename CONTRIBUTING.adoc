## Code clarity guidelines
### In vue files' <template>

Language :: pug
Indentation :: 2 spaces

#### Directives

Only the following should be written in directives

* a unique scalar value
** for template strings, interpolated values should be variables only.
* a unique function call
* a unique variable

##### An exception for conditional directives (`v-if`, `v-else-if`)

In conditonnal directives, the value can be one of the above, or a logical-operator-separated list of variables, but there must be at most two operators.

.Example
```pug
template(v-if="loggedIn || passwordForgotten")
```

If the exact same condition is reused, make a computed property instead.

### In vue _component_ files' <style>
  
Language :: stylus
Indentation :: 2 spaces

### Sections
Separate your styles into sections using the following comment decorations (including the surrounding blank lines):

```

//
// Section name
//

```

Include the following sections (even if empty), in order:

. Definitions +
  _Includes stylus variables & functions as well as CSS variables_
. Layout +
  _Includes `position`, `display`, all positioning, sizing & spacing-related properties_
. Decoration +
  _Includes all `border-` properties, `outline` & `box-shadow`.
. Colors +
  _Includes `color`, `background-color`, `opacity`._
. Typography +
  _Includes all `font-` properties and `text-decoration`._
. Reactions +
  _Includes selectors that use `:hover`, `:focus` or other interaction-related pseudo selectors or classes, as well as `transition`, `animation` and `@keyframes`._
. Hacks +
  _CSS Hacks / bad practice styling rules_
  
### Selector nesting

.Nest selectors when...
* The class name is not unique to the component
* Constructing multiple selectors with `&` becomes more readable than listing all selectors explicitly (should *not* exceed 3 indentation levels)

### Selector separations

- Put 2 empty lines between selectors that apply to a different part of the component
- Put 1 empty lines between selectors that apply to the same part of the component

### Value references

Sometimes, we're forced to use constant values when refering to something else (eg. the padding on this component should be equal to the navbar's height).

These kind of rules, if left undocumented, are huge sources of confusion when values referenced change.

To work around this, add a comment above or after the rule:

.Reference notice comment specification
```
//ref: <COMPONENT_NAME> [SELECTOR] REFERENCED_PROPERTY [(EXPLANATION)]
```

With:

COMPONENT_NAME :: The referenced component
SELECTOR :: The selector (if omitted, the selector is the component's root element)
REFERENCED_PROPERTY :: The property the rule gets its value from
EXPLANATION :: Explain why you must do a reference.

## Commit messages

This repository follows the https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji[gitmoji] commit standard.
Additonal conventions are added on top of the intent-indicating emoji. Here's how commit titles should be constructed:

```
EMOJI [SCOPE_PREFIX SCOPE SCOPE_SUFFIX] IMPERATIVE_SENTENCE
```

With:

EMOJI :: The emoji used. Must follow the gitmoji standard. A second emoji can be appended to the first if it is one of the following:
- ðŸ’© (Writing bad code that needs to be fixed)
- ðŸš§ (Work in progress)
SCOPE_PREFIX, SCOPE_SUFFIX :: Indicates if the changes apply to one particular area of the codebase. Must be one of the <<Scope Prefix/Suffix characters>>
SCOPE :: Indicates the file/topic affected.
IMPERATIVE_SENTENCE :: A sentence at the imperative tense, indicating the change applied to the codebase.


### Scope Prefix/Suffix characters
The scope prefix indicates what area of the codebase changed.
Less specific than the scope itself, but useful because file names overlaps. (eg. homework is a page & vuex module)

.Prefixes
[horizontal]
pass:[=] :: Store (vuex)
< :: Components
/ :: Pages
$ :: Plugins
? :: Tests
% :: Layouts
~ :: Middlewares
pass:[#] :: Assets
&nbsp; :: Other (no scope prefix)

.Suffixes
[horizontal]
pass:[>] :: Components
: :: Everything else
